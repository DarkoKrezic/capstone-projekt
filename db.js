      "Once upon a time, there was a little cow named Daisy. She was a curious cow, always looking for new adventures. One day, Daisy decided she wanted to fly. She asked all the other animals in the meadow if they could help her, but none of them could. So Daisy decided to take matters into her own hooves. She gathered some sticks and leaves and made a pair of wings. She tied them to her back and jumped off a hill. Daisy flapped her wings and flew higher and higher. She flew over the meadow, the river, and the forest. She even flew over the mountains. Daisy was so happy! She had achieved her dream of flying. But then, Daisy started to get tired. She flapped her wings harder and harder, but she couldn't stay in the air. She started to fall. Luckily, Daisy landed safely in the meadow. She was so proud of herself for trying. From that day on, Daisy never stopped dreaming of flying.",

      "Once upon a time, there were three lions who lived in the Savannah. They were very curious creatures and wanted to know what it was like to be a horse. One day, they decided to try and make their dream come true. The first lion tried to stand on two legs, like a horse, but he couldn’t balance. The second lion tried to walk on all fours, like a horse, but he just couldn’t manage it. The third lion then had an idea. He said, “Why don’t we try to gallop like a horse?”The three lions started to gallop around the Savannah, but they soon realized that they weren’t very good at it. They were still lions, after all. They were too big and too heavy to be horses.The three lions stopped and looked at each other. They were a bit embarrassed, but they also realized that it was okay to be themselves. They were lions, not horses, and that was something to be proud of.So, the three lions went back to their pride and never tried to be horses again. They were happy to be lions and to live in the Savannah.",
